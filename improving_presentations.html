    <h2>About the project </h2>
    <p>This project is a part of a research study being conducted at the University of Washington led by Kelly Mack under the advisement of Jennifer Mankoff and Megan Hofmann. This study is IRB approved.</p>

    <h2>About the tool </h2>
    <p>This tool has built in features that might help make the slides easier for you to use/consume. In addition to trying these different features under the "Corrections" pane, we would like you to let us know if there are any other ways the slides could be more accessible for you or help you learn better. Please let us know how we can make the slides better with the "Feedback" pane.</p>

    <p>Please see our <a href="">Privacy Policy</a> to understand what data will be collected and how it will be used, or watch <a href="https://youtu.be/3DtOTSrheo8"> this video.</a></p>

    <p> Transcript: Thanks for using our slide improvement tool. There are two main features. The feedback pane lets you tell us how slides could be more accessible or help you learn better. When you fill out the feedback pane, the current slide you are viewing will be logged to a folder in your Google Drive. The corrections pane lets you try a few features we built that can help improve the accessibility or usability of the slides. Any of the slides that you run the corrections on will be logged twice, once before the feature is run and once after. Both these slides and the slides logged via the feedback interface will be stored in two folders we create on your Google Drive. These folders will be shared with the lead researcher on the project. You can review this data and remove any logged data for the duration of the study. Please contact us if you have any questions/would like to remove data after the conclusion of the study. Finally, professors who use this tool will have the option to run a preset list of accommodations based on their class' needs. This data will be stored in a third folder on their drive. Please contact us at kmack3@cs.washington.edu if you have any questions, comments, or concerns.</p>
