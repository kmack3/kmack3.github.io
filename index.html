        	<h2 id="about_header"> About Me </h2>
        	<p> 
        		I am a senior studying Computer Science with minors in Mathematics and Business at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. I am exploring my research interests as an undergrad; currently I am interested in the intersection of computer science and medicine. Specifically, I am passionate about accessibility and assistive technology, as well as designing technology to help those  with chronic illnesses. I plan to pursue a PhD in HCI, preferably focusing on the aforementioned areas.

        	<p>
        		For fun, I like to take <a href="photos.html">pictures</a> of the places I visit and <a href="embroidery.html">embroidering</a> for my family and friends. I also enjoy playing the violin; I have been in a campus orchestra all four years at UIUC. Some of my favorite pieces include <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmCnQDUSO4I">Shostakovich's Waltz No. 2</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izQsgE0L450">Barber's Adagio for Strings</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8mKsNTh4Kw">Rachmaninoff's Piano Concerto No. 2</a>. Though, my absolute favorite work will always be <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7U_gpW1J4LM">Tchaikovsky's Nutcracker</a>.
