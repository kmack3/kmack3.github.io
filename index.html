                          <p> In this work, we investigated disability representation in images output from text-to-image (T2I) generative AI systems. Through eight focus groups with 25 people with disabilities, we found that models repeatedly presented reductive archetypes for different disabilities. Often these representations reflected broader societal stereo- types and biases, which our participants were concerned to see reproduced through T2I. Our participants discussed further challenges with using these models including the current reliance on prompt engineering to reach satisfactorily diverse results. Finally, they offered suggestions for how to improve disability representation with solutions like showing multiple, heterogeneous images for a single prompt and including the prompt with images generated. Our discussion reflects on tensions and tradeoffs we found among the diverse perspectives shared to inform future research on representation-oriented generative AI system evaluation metrics and development processes.</p>

                          <p> Digital avatars are an important part of identity representation, but there is little work on understanding how to represent disability. In our study, participants generally preferred to represent their disability identity if the context felt safe and platforms supported their expression, as it was important for feeling authentically represented. They also utilized avatars in strategic ways: as a means to signal and disclose current abilities, access needs, and to raise awareness. Some participants even found avatars to be a more accessible way to communicate than alternatives. We discuss how avatars can support disability identity representation because of their easily customizable format that is not strictly tied to reality. We suggest design recommendations for creating platforms that better support people in representing their disability and other minoritized identities.</p>

                          <p>In order for "human-centered research" to include all humans, we need to make sure that research practices are accessible for both participants and researchers with disabilities. Yet, people rarely discuss how to make common methods accessible. We interviewed 17 accessibility experts who were researchers or community organizers about their practices. Our findings emphasize the importance of considering accessibility at all stages of the research process and across different dimensions of studies like communication, materials, time, and space. We explore how technology or processes could reflect a norm of accessibility and offer a practical structure for planning accessible research.</p>

                          <p>Alternative (alt) text is a description of a digital images so that someone who is blind or low vision or otherwise uses a screen reader to understand image content. Little work examines what it is like to write alt text for an image. We created interface designs to support writing and providing feedback about alt text and tested them with people who write alt text and people who use alt text. Our results suggest that authoring interfaces that support authors in choosing what to include in their descriptions result in higher quality alt text. The feedback interfaces highlighted considerable diferences in the perceptions of authors and SRUs regarding “high-quality” alt text. We discuss the implications of these results on applications that support alt text.</p>

                          <p>Accessibility research has grown substantially in the past few decades, yet there has been no literature review of the field. To  understand current and historical trends, we created and analyzed a dataset of accessibility papers appearing at CHI and ASSETS since ASSETS’ founding in 1994. Our findings highlight  areas that have received disproportionate attention and those that are underserved— for example, over 43% of papers in the past  10 years are on accessibility for blind and low vision people. We also capture common study characteristics, such as the roles of  disabled and nondisabled participants as well as sample sizes (e.g., a median of 13 for participant groups with disabilities and  older adults). We close by critically reflecting on gaps in the literature and offering guidance for future work in the field. </p>

                          <p>Social media platforms support the sharing of written text, video, and audio. All of these formats may be inaccessible to people who are d/Deaf or hard of hearing and use sign language: Deaf signers. We study how Deaf signers engage with social platforms, focusing on how they share content and the barriers they face. We employ a mixed-methods approach involving seven in-depth interviews and a survey of a larger population (n = 60). We find that Deaf signers share the most in written English, despite their desire to share in sign language. We further identify key areas of difficulty in consuming content (e.g., lack of captions for spoken content in videos) and producing content (e.g., captioning signed videos, signing into a phone camera) on social media platforms. Our results reveal potential ways to make social media platforms more accessible to Deaf signers. </p>

            <!-- <h2 id="fun_header"> For Fun </h2>
            <p>
                For fun, I like to take pictures of the places I visit and <a href="embroidery.html">embroidering</a> for my family and friends. I also enjoy playing the violin; I have been in a campus orchestra all four years at UIUC. Some of my favorite pieces include <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmCnQDUSO4I">Shostakovich's Waltz No. 2</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izQsgE0L450">Barber's Adagio for Strings</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8mKsNTh4Kw">Rachmaninoff's Piano Concerto No. 2</a>. Though, my absolute favorite work will always be <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7U_gpW1J4LM">Tchaikovsky's Nutcracker</a>.
