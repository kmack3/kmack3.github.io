    <h1 class="black_title">Understanding Accommodations Reserach Project</h1>

    <h2>Study Recruitment </h2>
    
    <p>Are you a DRS student? Or do you have a disability/chronic condition/mental health issue that affects your access to your classes? We think that you could be a great participant for our study to learn how increased transparency and communication can impact accommodation in higher education.

    During Winter 2022 we will ask you to:</p>
 
    <ul>
       <li>Use a simple issue tracking tool to communicate about DRS accommodation requests with at least one of your professors </li>
       <li>We may ask you to complete a 45-75 minute pre-interview or post-interview </li>
       <li>Fill out a short (< 5 minute) survey each week. </li>
    </ul>
 
   <p><strong>Students will also be compensated $5 per survey that they fill out and $40/hr of interviews.</strong></p>


   <p>First, please <a href="https://forms.gle/6e9aApMtTjwgjRU56"> fill out this screener survey</a> if you are interested, so that we can collect a diverse sample group. If you qualify for the study and we have space for participants, a researcher will email you with more information about the study. 

   Feel free to contact this email at kmack3@cs.washington.edu for any questions or concerns.</p>

    <p>This project is a part of a research study being conducted at the University of Washington led by Kelly Mack under the advisement of Jennifer Mankoff. This study is IRB approved.</p>
